		<h2>LockDown</h2>
			<h3>Phase 1 (25 March – 14 April)</h3>
			<p>
				On 25 March, the first day of the lockdown, nearly all services and factories were suspended.<br>
				People were hurrying to stock essentials in some parts.Arrests across the states were made for<br>
				violating norms of lockdown such as venturing out for no emergency, opening businesses and home<br>
				quarantine violations.The government held meetings with e-commerce websites and vendors to<br>
				ensure a seamless supply of essential goods across the nation during the lockdown period. Several<br>
				states announced relief funds for the poor and affected people while the central government was<br>
				finalising a stimulus package.<br>
			</P>
			
			<h3>Phase 2 (15 April – 3 May)</h3>
			<p>
				On 14 April, PM Modi extended the nationwide lockdown till 3 May, with a conditional relaxation<br>
				promised after 20 April for the regions where the spread had been contained by then. He said<br>
				that every town, every police station area and every state would be carefully evaluated to<br>
				see if it had contained the spread. The areas that were able to do so would be released<br>
				from the lockdown on 20 April. If any new cases emerged in those areas, lockdown could<br>
				be reimposed.<br>
			</p>
			
			<h3>Phase 3 (4–17 May)</h3>
			<p>
				On 1 May, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) and the Government of India (GoI) further<br>
				extended the lockdown  period to two weeks beyond 4 May, with some relaxations. The <br>
				country  has been split into 3 zones: red zones (130 districts), orange zones (284 districts)<br>
				and green zones (319 districts).  Red zones are those with high coronavirus<br>
				 cases and a high doubling rate, orange zones are those with comparatively fewer cases<br>
				 and green zones are those without any cases in the past 21 days. Normal movement is<br>
				 permitted in green zones with buses limited to 50 percent capacity. Orange zones<br>
				 would allow only private and hired vehicles but no public transportation. The red<br>
				 zones would remain under lockdown. The zone classification would be revised once a week.<br>
			</p>
			
			<h3>Phase 4 (18–31 May)</h3>
			<p>
				On 17 May, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and the Ministry of Home<br>
				Affairs (MHA)extended the lockdown for a period for two weeks beyond 18 May, with<br> 
				additional relaxations. Unlike the previous extensions, states were given a larger<br>
				say in the demarcation of Green, Orange and Red zones and the implementation roadmap.<br>
				 Red zones were further divided into containment and buffer zones. The local bodies<br>
				 were given the authority to demarcate containment and buffer zones.

				The MHA issued fresh guidelines for the month of June, stating that the phases of<br>
				reopening would "have an economic focus". Lockdown restrictions were only be imposed<br>
				in containment zones, while activities were permitted in other zones in a phased <br>
				manner. This first phase of reopening was termed as "Unlock 1.0" and permitted<br>
				shopping malls, religious places, hotels and restaurants to reopen from 8 June.<br>
				Large gatherings were still banned, but there were no restrictions on inter-state<br>
				travel. Night curfews were in effect from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. in all areas and state<br>
				governments were allowed to impose suitable restrictions on all activities.In future<br>
				phases of reopening, further activities are to be permitted. In Phase II,<br>
				all educational institutions are scheduled to reopen in August, pending consultations<br>
				with state governments. In Phase III, easing of restrictions on international air travel,<br>
				operation of metros and recreational activities (swimming pools, gymnasiums, theatres,<br>
				entertainment parks, bars, auditoriums and assembly halls) would be decided upon in August.

			<h3>Unlock 2.0 (1–31 July)</h3>
			<p>
				Phase II of Unlock began on 1 July under the guidelines and instructions of the MHA and the NDMA.<br>
				Lockdown measures are only imposed in containment zones. In all other areas, most activities are<br>
				permitted. Night curfews would be in effect from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. in all areas. State governments<br>
				would be allowed to put suitable restrictions on all activities, but state borders are to remain open<br>
				to all. Inter- and intra-state travel is permitted. Limited international travel has been permitted as<br>
				part of the Vande Bharat Mission. Shops are now permitted to allow more than five persons at a time.<br>
				Educational institutions, metros, recreational activities are to remain closed till 31 July. Only<br>
				essential activities are permitted in containment zones, while maintaining strict parameter control<br>
